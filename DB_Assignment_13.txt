1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High
Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”
==>>
select  Cname,city, (case when rating >=200 then 'High Rating' else 'Low Rating'  end) as rating  from customers 
			union
select  cname,city ,(case when rating <200 then 'Low Rating' else 'High Rating' end)   from customers ;



2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and
each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical
order.
==>>
select Sname,Snum,Cname from salespeople join customers using (Snum) where snum in
(select Snum from customers group by Snum having count(Snum) > 1) order by Sname,Cname;





3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the
onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries
but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is
besides the point.)
==>>
SELECT snum
FROM salespeople
WHERE city='san jose'
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT snum
FROM orders
WHERE snum IN
    (SELECT snum
     FROM orders
     WHERE odate LIKE '03-OCT-%');
